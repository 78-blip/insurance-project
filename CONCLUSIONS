The conclusion of our project here is:

1.age of the customer has not much to do with response of customer,soit is not inclined to any particular response.

2.annual premium to be paid has good impact on response of the customer,higher the premium,more likely is customer willing to say no.

3.whether the vehicle is already insured or not is also affecting our response.

4.we have to keep our focus on certain customers only whose variables are somehow showing the response yes according to prediction.

5.we have to filter out the parameters in order to have a glimpse of our response.
