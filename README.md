# CLASSIFICATION PROJECT-INSURANCE DECISIONING THROUGH NAIVE BAYES AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION
# DATA
Answer Here

id -unique id ,represents each row uniquely. 

Gender -whether the buyer is male or female

Age -age of buyer 

Driving_License -whether buyer holds license or not 

Region_Code -region Previously_Insured -whether has insurance already or not 

Vehicle_Age -vehicles used Vehicle_Damage -condition of vehicle 

Annual_Premium -premium amount given Policy_Sales_Channel -

sales channel Vintage -vintage 

Response -dependent variable,whether he id potential buyer or not

# SUMMARY
Here we are given various factors or variables keeping them in mind ,we have been given whether a customer is interested in insuring vehicles or not.

here our task is to:

:cleaning and casting data to make it fit in the model'

:to adjust our dataset in prediction model ,whicg gives good acuracy of customers response about insuring

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
MAKE A GOOD PREDICTION MODEL TO FIT THE DATASET OF VAHICLES INSURANCE PREDICTION WHEREBY:

THERE SHOULD BE GOOD AND ACCURATE PREDICTION OF CUSTOMER'S RESPONSE IN RESPECT TO MINDSET ABOUT PURCHASING INSURANCE.

THE MODEL SHOULD BE CLEARLY UNDERSTANDABLE.

# BUSINESS OBJECTIVE
Our business objective is to make a good accuracy predisction model which:

:predicts customer's inclination towards purchasing insurance by keeping a view on various other factors which ifluence it like-vehicles's age,gender,etc.

# LIABRARIES USED

NUMPY: NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. It adds powerful data structures to Python that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.

PANDAS: Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

MATPLOTLIB Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible. Create publication quality plots. Make interactive figures that can zoom, pan, update.

SEABORN Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures. Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data.

# ALGORITHMS USED:
LOGISTIC REGRESSION
Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable. The most common logistic regression models a binary outcome; something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on.

NAIVE BAYES
The Na√Øve Bayes classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm, which is used for classification tasks, like text classification. It is also part of a family of generative learning algorithms, meaning that it seeks to model the distribution of inputs of a given class or category.
