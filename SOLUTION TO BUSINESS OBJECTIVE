HEREBY MY SUGGESTIONS FOR CLIENT TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:

1.as we can see ,response of a customer depends upon various factors which includes 'id', 'Gender', 'Age', 'Driving_License', 'Region_Code', 'Previously_Insured', 'Vehicle_Age', 'Vehicle_Damage', 'Annual_Premium', 'Policy_Sales_Channel', 'Vintage'

2.by looking at some parameter we can predict our response of customer ,for example if vehicle's age is quite much and premium amount is less,customer is willing to buy the insurance.

3.somehow we can predict our response on the basis of gender and age .

4.most of the time response of our customer is 0.

5.somehow most of the prediction is in favour of 0.

6.i will suggest the client to keep focus on certain customer understanding certain parameters which have more probability for buying insurance.
